# Software Installation

If you are using the optional Blinkt, you will need to install the library code on your Raspberry Pi Zero. This requires an internet connection.

You can either:

1. Connect the Raspberry Pi Zero to the internet using a USB-to-Ethernet dongle

1. If you have a Raspberry Pi with an internet connection, you could transfer your SD card into the Raspberry Pi to install the libraries, then transfer it back to the Pi Zero.

Once you are connected to the internet, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-blinkt
```
More information can be found on the [Getting started with Blinkt](https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/getting-started-with-blinkt) page on the Pimoroni website.
