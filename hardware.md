# Hardware Requirements

This resource uses the pins on the Raspberry Pi Zero, so you will need to use a soldering iron to attach the header.

We use a micro USB power pack to provide portable power. We recommend you use a micro USB power pack of the type intended for charging mobile phones.

You will also need a special Raspberry Pi Zero camera cable to make the camera module compatible with the Raspberry Pi Zero, as the standard camera cable is too large.
